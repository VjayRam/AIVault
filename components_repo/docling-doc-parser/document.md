## 1. Introduction

This section gives a scope description and overview of everything included in this SRS document. Also, the purpose for this document is described and a list of abbreviations and definitions is provided.

## 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to give a detailed description of the requirements for the 'Amazing Lunch Indicator' (ALI) software. It will illustrate the purpose and complete declaration for the development of system. It will also explain system constraints, interface and interactions with other external applications. This document is primarily intended to be proposed to a customer for its approval and a reference for developing the first version of the system for the development team.

## 1.2 Scope

The 'Amazing Lunch Indicator' is a GPS-based mobile application which helps people to find the closest restaurants based on the user's current position and other specification like price, restaurant type, dish and more. The application should be free to download from either a mobile phone application store or similar services.

Restaurant owners can provide their restaurant information using the web-portal. This information will act as the bases for the search results displayed to the user. An administrator also uses the web-portal in order to administer the system and keep the information accurate. The administrator can, for instance, verify restaurant owners and manage user information.

Furthermore, the software needs both Internet and GPS connection to fetch and display results. All system information is maintained in a database, which is located on a web-server. The software also interacts with the GPS-Navigator software which is required to be an already installed application on the user's mobile phone. By using the GPS-Navigator, users can view desired restaurants on a map and be navigated to them. The application also has the capability of representing both summary and detailed information about the restaurants.

## 1.5 Overview

The remainder of this document includes three chapters and appendixes. The second one provides an overview of the system functionality and system interaction with other systems. This chapter also introduces different types of stakeholders and their interaction with the system. Further, the chapter also mentions the system constraints and assumptions about the product.

The third chapter provides the requirements specification in detailed terms and a description of the different system interfaces. Different specification techniques are used in order to specify the requirements more precisely for different audiences.

The fourth chapter deals with the prioritization of the requirements. It includes a motivation for the chosen prioritization methods and discusses why other alternatives were not chosen.

The Appendixes in the end of the document include the all results of the requirement prioritization and a release plan based on them.

## 2. Overall description

This section will give an overview of the whole system. The system will be explained in its context to show how the system interacts with other systems and introduce the basic functionality of it. It will also describe what type of stakeholders that will use the system and what functionality is available for each type. At last, the constraints and assumptions for the system will be presented.

## 2.1 Product perspective

This system will consist of two parts: one mobile application and one web portal. The mobile application will be used to find restaurants and view information about them while the web portal will be used for managing the information about the restaurants and the system as a whole. Mobile Software

The mobile application will need to communicate to a GPS application within the mobile phone, which in turn communicates with a physical GPS device to find the location of the user, see Figure 1. The GPS will provide the mobile application with locations of both the user and the restaurants and the distance between them, but it will also provide maps and the functionality to display the application's data on the map. The functionality provided by the GPS will be embedded into the application in order for the user to be able to use the functions in the application in a seamlessly manner.

Since this is a data-centric product it will need somewhere to store the data. For that, a database will be used. Both the mobile application and web portal will communicate with the database, however in slightly different ways. The mobile application will only use the database to get data while the web portal will also add and modify data. All of the database communication will go over the Internet.

The mobile application has some restrictions about the resource allocation. To avoid problems with overloading the operating system the application is only allowed to use 20 megabytes of memory while running the application. The maximum amount of hard drive space is also 20 megabytes.

## 2.2 Product functions

With the mobile application, the users will be able to search for restaurants. The result will be based on the criteria the user inputs. There are several search criteria and it will be possible for the administrator of the system to manage the options for those criteria that have that.

The result of the search will be viewed either in a list view or in a map view, depending on what criteria included in the search. The list view will have one list item for each restaurant matching the search criteria and show a small part of the restaurant information so the user can identify the restaurant. The

Figure 1 - Block diagram

<!-- image -->

map view will show each restaurant location as a pin on the map as well as the user's own location. In both views the users will be able to either select a restaurant as target destination or get information how to get there, or view the information of a specific restaurant.

The web portal will provide functionality to manage the system and the restaurant information. It will also provide information about the system, for example show when there is a new update.

## 2.3 User characteristics

There are three types of users that interact with the system: users of the mobile application, restaurant owners and administrators. Each of these three types of users has different use of the system so each of them has their own requirements.

The mobile application users can only use the application to find a restaurant. This means that the user have to be able to search for restaurants, choose a restaurant from that search and then navigate to it. In order for the users to get a relevant search result there are multiple criteria the users can specify and all results matches all of those.

The restaurant owners will not use the mobile application but the web portal instead. There they will manage the information about their restaurant, for example a description of the restaurant, contact information and their menu.

The administrators also only interact with the web portal. They are managing the overall system so there is no incorrect information within it. The administrator can manage the information for each restaurant as well as the options for both the mobile application users and the restaurant owners.

## 2.4 Constraints

The mobile application is constrained by the system interface to the GPS navigation system within the mobile phone. Since there are multiple system and multiple GPS manufacturers, the interface will most likely not be the same for every one of them. Also, there may be a difference between what navigation features each of them provide.

The Internet connection is also a constraint for the application. Since the application fetches data from the database over the Internet, it is crucial that there is an Internet connection for the application to function.

Both the web portal and the mobile application will be constrained by the capacity of the database. Since the database is shared between both application it may be forced to queue incoming requests and therefor increase the time it takes to fetch data.

## 2.5 Assumptions and dependencies

One assumption about the product is that it will always be used on mobile phones that have enough performance. If the phone does not have enough hardware resources available for the application, for example the users might have allocated them with other applications, there may be scenarios where the application does not work as intended or even at all.

Another assumption is that the GPS components in all phones work in the same way. If the phones have different interfaces to the GPS, the application need to be specifically adjusted to each interface and that

would mean the integration with the GPS would have different requirements than what is stated in this specification.

## 2.6 Apportioning of requirements

In the case that the project is delayed, there are some requirements that could be transferred to the next version of the application. Those requirements are to be developed in the third release, see Appendix IV.

## 3. Specific requirements

This section contains all of the functional and quality requirements of the system. It gives a detailed description of the system and all its features.

## 3.1 External interface Requirements

This section provides a detailed description of all inputs into and outputs from the system. It also gives a description of the hardware, software and communication interfaces and provides basic prototypes of the user interface.

## 3.1.1 User interfaces

A first-time user of the mobile application should see the log-in page when he/she opens the application, see Figure 2. If the user has not registered, he/she should be able to do that on the log-in page.

If the user is not a first-time user, he/she should be able to see the search page directly when the application is opened, see Figure 3. Here the user chooses the type of search he/she wants to conduct.

Every user should have a profile page where they can edit their e-mail address, phone number and password, see Figure 4. Also, the user can set the mobile application to his/her preferred language. The 'P' icon shows where the user can click to navigate to his/her profile page.

Figure 4 - Profile page

<!-- image -->

In Figure 5, the list view for the results is shown. When a user searches by price, this view should be the default one. The sorting header allows the user to sort the results according to price, restaurant name, distance, restaurant type and specific dish. Each result item includes information about the restaurants, a link to the restaurant's web-page and an information link, which provides a more detailed description of the restaurant. There is also a filtering option, where the user can choose to filter the results by increasing or decreasing the price or distance range, see Figure 7.

In the map view each restaurant is represented by a pin, see Figure 6. Next to every pin there is an information link which provides a more detailed description of the restaurant, as mentioned for the list view. The same filtering option, as for the list view, is included in the map view.

The restaurant owners and administrators interact with the system through a web-portal, see Figure 8. A restaurant owner should be able to register on the web-portal in order to log in and manage the restaurant information. An administrator should also be able to log in to the web-portal where he/she can administer the system by for instance editing restaurant or user information.

Figure 8 - Web Portal

## 3.1.2 Hardware interfaces

Since neither the mobile application nor the web portal have any designated hardware, it does not have any direct hardware interfaces. The physical GPS is managed by the GPS application in the mobile phone and the hardware connection to the database server is managed by the underlying operating system on the mobile phone and the web server.

## 3.1.3 Software interfaces

The mobile application communicates with the GPS application in order to get geographical information

about where the user is located and the visual representation of it, and with the database in order to get the information about the restaurants, see Figure 1. The communication between the database and the web portal consists of operation concerning both reading and modifying the data, while the communication between the database and the mobile application consists of only reading operations.

## 3.1.4 Communications interfaces

The communication between the different parts of the system is important since they depend on each other. However, in what way the communication is achieved is not important for the system and is therefore handled by the underlying operating systems for both the mobile application and the web portal.

## 4. Prioritization and Release Plan

In order to get a view of how to divide the requirements into different releases and what requirements should be included in which release, a prioritization of the requirements is needed. This section discusses the choice of prioritization methods and gives a suggestion of how the release plan for these requirements could look like.

## 4.1 Choice of prioritization method

When prioritizing the requirements the ten most important ones were picked out first. This was done with a simple '1 to 10' ranking method, with one being 'not important' and ten 'very important'. Based on the elicitation meetings, and the perceived ideas of what was important to the different stakeholders, a number was set for each requirement. The numbers were then summed up for each requirement and the ten with the highest score were chosen to be prioritized with the cost value approach. The results, which are red-marked, can be seen in Appendix I and as shown, it turned out to be five functional requirements and five quality requirements. These requirements were then prioritized according to the cost value approach and the results can be viewed under Appendix II.

The remaining requirements were prioritized according to the 'Five-Way Priority Scheme' as shown in Appendix III. This method was chosen since it gives the different stakeholders the same importance and has an enough wide range for determining which requirement is more important than the other [3]. However, in this prioritization process, the development team was not included as a stakeholder since the different features were not considered to be as important to them as for the other stakeholders.

Other methods for prioritization, such as the hundred-dollar test and the yes-no vote, were also considered. The hundred-dollar test is quite similar to the five-way priority scheme, since it also gives a wide range for ranking the requirements. However, it is more easily misused since someone could save all their money and put them on a requirement that they think is very important [3]. Others might not agree that this requirement is important but it might still get the most votes since one person cared about it [3].

The yes-no vote method might be fairly simple to carry out, however the range is too narrow. For instance, if two requirements are not very important it would be hard to determine which of those requirements that is more important than the other [3].

In conclusion, weighing the disadvantages and advantages of these methods against each other lead us to choose the five-way priority scheme.

## 4.2 Release Plan

The requirements were divided into three releases based on the prioritization and their dependencies. The three different releases were assembled so that each would work as a fully functional application.

In the first release the requirements that build up the foundation of the application were included, together with the most highly prioritized requirements and their dependencies.

The second release also includes important requirements. However, these requirements are not vital for a functional application. They are more suited to act as additional features that can contribute to making the software product more attractive.

The third release includes the requirements that can be afforded to discard if the project gets delayed or overruns the budget.

For further details about the release plan, see Appendix IV.
